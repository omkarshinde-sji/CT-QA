  '## Overview

Review **docs/ai-agent-suggestions.md** for the full analysis of 50+ AI agents from the SJ Innovation catalog mapped against this project''s infrastructure.

This task covers the **14 Tier 1 agents** that can be implemented immediately by seeding rows into the `ai_agents` table — no new tables, no new Edge Functions required.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Craft System Prompts
For each agent, write a system prompt that defines the agent''s role, specifies data sources, sets output format, and includes guardrails.

### Step 2: Insert into ai_agents table
Use this SQL pattern:

INSERT INTO ai_agents (name, slug, description, system_prompt, category, is_enabled, welcome_message, conversation_starters, data_sources) VALUES (''Agent Name'', ''agent-slug'', ''Description'', ''System prompt...'', ''category'', true, ''Welcome message'', ''["Starter 1", "Starter 2"]''::jsonb, ''["table1", "table2"]''::jsonb);

### Step 3: Test via AI Hub
1. Navigate to AI Hub
2. Verify each agent appears
3. Test with sample prompts
4. Iterate on system prompts

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- All 14 agents seeded into ai_agents table
- Each agent has a well-crafted system prompt
- Each agent has conversation starters configured
- Each agent has appropriate data_sources JSON
- All agents visible and runnable in AI Hub
- High-priority agents tested with at least 3 sample prompts each
